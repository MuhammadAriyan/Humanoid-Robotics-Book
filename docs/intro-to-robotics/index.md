# Chapter 1: Introduction to Robotics

## Overview

Welcome to the foundational chapter of our journey into the world of robotics. This chapter serves as a comprehensive introduction to the field, designed to provide you with a solid understanding of its core concepts, historical development, and multifaceted nature. We will explore what constitutes a "robot," delve into the key disciplines that converge to make robotics possible, and trace the evolution of robotic technology from ancient automatons to the sophisticated intelligent systems of today.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

- **Define robotics** and explain its interdisciplinary scope.
- **Identify the key components** that make up a modern robotic system.
- **Trace the historical timeline** of significant milestones in robotics.
- **Differentiate between various types** of robots and their applications.
- **Understand the fundamental principles** that govern robot design and operation.

This chapter will lay the groundwork for the more advanced topics we will cover later in this book. Let's begin our exploration.
