# 1.1 What is Robotics?

## Definition of Robotics

Robotics is an interdisciplinary field at the intersection of science, engineering, and technology. It involves the design, construction, operation, and use of robots. The ultimate goal of robotics is to create intelligent machines that can perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously, often in environments that are dangerous, difficult, or tedious for humans.

### Key Disciplines in Robotics

- **Mechanical Engineering**: Deals with the design and construction of the robot's physical structure, kinematics, dynamics, and actuators (motors, gears).
- **Electrical Engineering**: Focuses on the power systems, sensors (e.g., cameras, lidar, ultrasonic), control systems, and wiring.
- **Computer Science/Software Engineering**: Involves programming the robot's intelligence, including artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, computer vision, path planning, and human-robot interaction (HRI).
- **Control Engineering**: Concerned with designing systems that ensure robots perform desired actions accurately and stably, often using feedback loops.

## What is a Robot?

A robot is a machine—especially one programmable by a computer—capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically. Robots can be guided by an external control device or the control may be embedded within.

### Essential Characteristics of a Robot

1.  **Sensing**: Robots collect information about their surroundings using sensors (e.g., cameras, microphones, touch sensors, GPS).
2.  **Movement/Actuation**: They can physically move or manipulate objects using motors, wheels, legs, arms, or grippers.
3.  **Intelligence/Programmability**: Robots can be programmed to perform specific tasks, make decisions, learn from their environment, or adapt their behavior.
4.  **Autonomy**: The degree to which a robot can operate without human intervention, ranging from teleoperated (human-controlled) to fully autonomous.

### Types of Robots (Brief Introduction)

-   **Industrial Robots**: Used in manufacturing for tasks like welding, assembly, and material handling (e.g., robotic arms).
-   **Mobile Robots**: Designed to move in their environment (e.g., autonomous guided vehicles (AGVs), drones, planetary rovers).
-   **Humanoid Robots**: Resemble the human body and can interact with human tools and environments (e.g., Boston Dynamics' Atlas, Honda's ASIMO).
-   **Service Robots**: Perform tasks for humans or equipment (e.g., vacuum cleaners, surgical robots, delivery robots).
