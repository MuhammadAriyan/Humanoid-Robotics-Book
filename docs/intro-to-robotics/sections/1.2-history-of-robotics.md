# 1.2 History of Robotics

## Early Concepts and Automatons (Ancient Times - 18th Century)

While the term "robot" is modern, the concept of automated machines has ancient roots. Early examples include:

-   **Ancient Egypt & Greece**: Mechanical birds, water clocks, and animated statues described by inventors like Hero of Alexandria.
-   **Medieval Islamic Golden Age**: Intricate automatons, including musical robots and programmable castles, created by engineers like Al-Jazari.
-   **Renaissance**: Leonardo da Vinci designed a knight automaton (c. 1495).
-   **18th Century**: "The Duck" by Jacques de Vaucanson (1739) could eat, drink, and excrete, showcasing complex mechanical artistry.

## Industrial Revolution & Early Modern Automation (19th Century - Mid-20th Century)

-   **Jacquard Loom (1801)**: Joseph Marie Jacquard's loom used punched cards to automatically weave complex patterns, a precursor to programmable machines.
-   **Term "Robot" (1920)**: Coined by Czech writer Karel Čapek in his play *R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)*. The word *robota* means "forced labor" in Czech.
-   **Science Fiction**: Isaac Asimov's stories (1940s) popularized robots and introduced the "Three Laws of Robotics."

## The Dawn of Modern Robotics (Mid-20th Century - 1980s)

This era saw the birth of practical, programmable robots, largely driven by industrial needs.

-   **First Industrial Robot (1954)**: George Devol patented "Programmed Article Transfer." In 1961, the first industrial robot, **Unimate**, based on Devol's patent, was installed at General Motors for handling hot die castings.
-   **Shakey the Robot (1960s)**: Developed at Stanford Research Institute (SRI), Shakey was the first mobile robot to reason about its own actions. It integrated perception, world modeling, and problem-solving, a landmark in AI.
-   **Robotics in Space**: The Soviet Lunokhod 1 (1970) and Lunokhod 2 (1973) were early robotic lunar rovers, showcasing remote control and mobility in extreme environments.

## Advancements in Computer Control & AI (1980s - 2000s)

-   **Personal Computers**: Increased computational power led to more sophisticated control algorithms.
-   **Vision Systems**: Development of computer vision allowed robots to "see" and interpret their surroundings more effectively.
-   **Honda ASIMO (2000)**: A significant step in humanoid robotics, demonstrating advanced bipedal locomotion and human-like interaction.

## Modern Robotics & The Age of Intelligent Systems (2000s - Present)

Recent decades have seen an explosion in robotics research and application, fueled by advances in AI, sensing, and miniaturization.

-   **Service Robots**: Proliferation of robots in daily life (e.g., robotic vacuum cleaners like Roomba, surgical robots like da Vinci).
-   **Autonomous Vehicles**: Development of self-driving cars and drones.
-   **Collaborative Robots (Cobots)**: Robots designed to work safely alongside humans in industrial settings.
-   **Advanced Humanoids**: Robots like Boston Dynamics' Atlas push boundaries in dynamic movement and manipulation.
-   **Soft Robotics**: A new field focusing on robots made from compliant materials, ideal for delicate interaction and navigating complex environments.

### Key Takeaways

-   Robotics has evolved from ancient philosophical concepts to highly functional, intelligent machines.
-   Each era brought new technological breakthroughs, from mechanical ingenuity to advanced AI.
-   The future of robotics promises even greater integration into human society and industry.
