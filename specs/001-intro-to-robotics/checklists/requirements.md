# Specification Quality Checklist: Chapter 1 - Introduction to Robotics

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning.
**Created**: 2025-12-05
**Feature**: [specs/001-intro-to-robotics/spec.md](specs/001-intro-to-robotics/spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs).
- [x] Focused on reader value and educational needs.
- [x] Written for a clear audience (beginners in robotics).
- [x] All mandatory sections completed.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain.
- [x] Requirements (Acceptance Criteria) are testable and unambiguous.
- [x] Success criteria (Acceptance Criteria) are measurable.
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details).
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined via user stories and criteria.
- [x] Edge cases (Common Misunderstandings) are identified.
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded to an introduction.
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified (None needed for this chapter).

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria.
- [x] User stories cover primary learning flows.
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Acceptance Criteria.
- [x] No implementation details leak into the specification.

## Notes

- The specification is comprehensive and clear. It provides a solid foundation for the authoring and planning phase. All checklist items are satisfied.
