# Physical & Humanoid Robotics Authoring Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Academic Rigor & Technical Clarity
All content MUST be factually accurate, technically sound, and well-researched. Explanations must be clear, unambiguous, and targeted at a professional engineering audience. Complex topics shall be broken down into understandable components without sacrificing depth.

### II. Structured, College-Notes-Inspired Format
Every chapter MUST follow a consistent, hierarchical structure to optimize learning and readability. The mandatory flow is:
1.  **Learning Objectives**: A bulleted list of key takeaways.
2.  **Core Concepts**: In-depth explanation of the topic.
3.  **Practical Examples**: Code snippets, diagrams, or case studies illustrating the concepts.
4.  **Exercises**: Problems or questions to reinforce learning.
5.  **Chapter Summary**: Concise review of the main points.
6.  **Glossary Terms**: Definitions of new terminology introduced in the chapter.

### III. Practical, Example-Driven Explanations
Theoretical concepts MUST be grounded in practical application. Every major concept or mathematical formula must be accompanied by a runnable code example, a clear diagram, or a real-world case study to ensure concepts are tangible and implementable.

### IV. Visual Excellence & Premium Design
The book MUST adhere to the highest visual standards to provide a premium reading experience. This includes:
-   **Diagrams**: Must be clean, professional, and consistent in style (e.g., using a tool like Mermaid.js or a consistent design language).
-   **Images**: Must be high-resolution and directly relevant to the content.
-   **Layout**: Adherence to Docusaurus best practices for a clean, navigable, and aesthetically pleasing interface.

### V. RAG-Optimized & Chunkable Content
All content MUST be structured for efficient machine retrieval and processing by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. This requires:
-   **Short Paragraphs**: Each paragraph should focus on a single, coherent idea.
-   **Clear Sections**: Use of headings and subheadings to create a logical, chunkable hierarchy.
-   **Atomic Concepts**: Important definitions and concepts must not be buried in long explanations.

### VI. Global Accessibility & Consistency
The content MUST be accessible to a global audience and prepared for future enhancements.
-   **Personalization Tags**: Use comment tags (`<!-- BEGINNER_EXPLAIN -->`, `<!-- ADVANCED_EXPLAIN -->`, `<!-- PRACTICAL_EXAMPLE -->`) to mark sections for future automated rewriting for different expertise levels.
-   **Urdu Translation Friendliness**: Write in clear, direct English, avoiding slang, complex idioms, and convoluted sentence structures to facilitate accurate translation.
-   **Global Terminology**: A central glossary will be maintained. All terms MUST be used consistently across all chapters.

### VII. Discoverability and Navigation
To ensure ease of access and a seamless user experience, all chapters MUST be easily discoverable.
-   **Navigation Bar**: Every new chapter must be added to the main navigation sidebar.
-   **Home Page**: The home page must be updated to include a link to every new chapter, providing a central point of entry for all content.

### VIII. Simplified Depth and Visual Storytelling
Every chapter MUST be both detailed and simplified. Complex topics should be broken down into easy-to-understand explanations without losing technical depth. To enhance comprehension, diagrams, flowcharts, and visual aids MUST be used extensively to illustrate concepts, processes, and architectures.

## Writing and Content Standards

### Tone, Language, and Reading Level
-   **Tone**: Authoritative, professional, and educational.
-   **Voice**: Active voice is preferred over passive voice.
-   **Reading Level**: Assumes a college-level understanding of engineering and computer science fundamentals.

### Formatting Rules
-   **Headings**: Strictly follow Markdown's heading hierarchy (H1 for title, H2 for major sections, etc.).
-   **Code Blocks**: All code MUST be formatted correctly with the appropriate language identifier (e.g., ` ```python`).
-   **Mathematical Notation**: Use LaTeX within Markdown for all mathematical formulas and equations for clarity and consistency.

### Content Creation Standards
-   **Code Examples**: Must be complete, runnable, and accompanied by comments explaining the logic.
-   **Diagrams**: Must include captions and be referenced in the text.
-   **Glossary**: Each new technical term must be defined and added to the chapter's glossary section.

## Quality and Consistency

### Cross-Chapter Consistency
A uniform style, tone, and structure MUST be maintained across all chapters. This includes consistent use of terminology, formatting, and explanation patterns. The global glossary is the single source of truth for all definitions.

### Quality Gates
Before publication, every chapter MUST pass a quality review checklist, which includes:
-   Verification of technical accuracy.
-   Adherence to all principles and standards in this constitution.
-   Checks for clarity, grammar, and spelling.
-   Validation of all code examples and exercises.

## Governance

### Versioning
This constitution follows Semantic Versioning (Major.Minor.Patch):
-   **MAJOR**: For backward-incompatible changes or fundamental shifts in principles.
-   **MINOR**: For the addition of new principles or significant expansions to existing ones.
-   **PATCH**: For clarifications, typo fixes, or minor formatting updates.

### Amendment Process
Any proposed changes to this constitution must be submitted as a formal proposal, reviewed for its impact on the project, and approved before implementation. All changes must be documented in the preamble of this document.

### Attribution
All published content under this project MUST provide clear attribution. The following links must be included in an "About the Author" or equivalent section:
-   **GitHub**: [https://github.com/muhammadariyan](https://github.com/muhammadariyan)
