# Ary's Physical Humanoid Robotics Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Home Page Integration (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All new chapters MUST be added to the home page in a dedicated chapters section. The home page serves as the primary navigation hub and must provide immediate access to all available content. This ensures users can discover and access all learning materials from the main entry point.

### II. Chapter-First Development
Every feature starts as a chapter; Chapters must be self-contained, independently navigable, and properly documented; Clear learning objectives required - no content without educational purpose.

### III. Progressive Learning Path
Content must follow logical progression from fundamentals to advanced topics; Each chapter must build upon previous knowledge; Prerequisites and learning outcomes must be clearly defined.

### IV. Visual Consistency
All chapters must maintain consistent styling and branding; Glassmorphism UI theme must be applied throughout; Navigation patterns must be uniform across all pages.

### V. Content Quality Standards
All content must be technically accurate and up-to-date; Real-world examples and practical applications required; Regular content reviews and updates mandatory.

## Development Workflow

### Chapter Creation Process
1. Chapter specification and approval
2. Content development and review
3. Home page integration (MANDATORY)
4. Navigation updates
5. Testing and validation

### Quality Gates
- Technical accuracy verification
- Educational effectiveness assessment
- UI/UX consistency check
- Home page integration verification

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require documentation, approval, and migration plan. All development must verify compliance with these principles.
